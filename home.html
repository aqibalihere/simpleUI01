        <p style="color: floralwhite;" >Pakistan is fortunate to have a population whose majority comprises a progressive youth with a lot of potential. It’s high time we realise this fact and capitalise on it by educating them so that they take charge of their own destiny and make use of the skills and expertise acquired in school. The City School has been around for more than three decades providing quality education across Pakistan through immaculate curriculum planning and the continuous professional development of its staff. Technological development has been at its fastest pace for the last two decades and our children have the ability to match this pace of growth, provided we equip them with the knowledge and skill to use this to their advantage. The Smart School is a groundbreaking initiative to empower our next generation with the knowledge and comprehension of technology and the benefits thereto. We endeavour to make standardised quality education accessible to all and plan to achieve this dream through The Smart School network all across Pakistan and beyond. We expect investors in Pakistan to come forward to utilise this great investment opportunity and benefit from the experience of The City School. </p>
